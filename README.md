Please note:
This was strictly for learning purposes. Most of the syntax used the traditional promise-based approach. Eventually, I would like to update this repo using
async/await. Also, the tutorial series did not use best modern React practices (such
as useCallbacks, useMemo, and properly adding dependencies to the useEffect hook.)
